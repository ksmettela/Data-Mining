# Supervised Machine Learning
This project aims to classify the independent component (IC) images of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans as Noise and Resting state network (RSN) using supervised learning techniques.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify IC images as RSN or Noise. The project will involve training a binary classification model on a dataset of 5 patients, where each patient's data is accompanied by a label list.

## Technology Requirements
- Python 3.6 to 3.9

## Project Description
The project consists of two main parts:

- Creating a single label type of RSN IC images: RSN ICs have different labels (1, 2, and 3). The first step is to create a list where only two labels are present: ‘0’ for Noise and ‘1’ for RSN. This is achieved by changing any labels greater than 0 as 1.
- Applying supervised learning techniques: Once the correct label lists are ready for the provided dataset, any supervised learning technique of choice can be applied to classify the Noise and RSN IC images.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of five patients' data, each containing approximately 100 spatial ICs of that patient's rs-fMRI scan.

## File Structure
- classification.py: This file will read all the images (images ending with the word "thresh") and labels from the given data, change the labels 1, 2, and 3 as ‘1’ for the RSN images, and train & generate a machine learning model based on the labels to classify the IC image as RSN or Noise. RSN IC image refers to label ‘1’ and Noise IC image refers to label ‘0’.

- test.py: This file will load the trained model generated by classification.py and classify the IC images in the "testPatient" folder as either RSN or Noise. The "testPatient" folder will contain a "test_Data" folder with IC images similar to the provided data, and a "test_Labels" csv file with the labels of the test patient data. test.py will output two csv files: "Results.csv," which will contain the labels classified as 0 (Noise) or 1 (RSN) for every IC image of the "testPatient," and "Metrics.csv," which will contain the results of metrics in the percentage format.

- Trained model: This file will be generated by classification.py and will be used by test.py to classify the IC images in the "testPatient" folder.

## Instructions for Running the Code
- Clone the repository to local machine.
- Run the classification.py file to train the model and generate the trained model file.
- Run the test.py file to classify the IC images in the "testPatient" folder and generate the results and metrics csv files.
- The results.csv and metrics.csv files will be generated in the same directory as the test.py file.

## Conclusion
In this project, a machine learning model is trained to classify independent component images of rs-fMRI scans as Noise or Resting State Network using supervised learning techniques. The code is provided in two Python files, classification.py and test.py, along with a trained model.
